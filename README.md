# Lift-Controller
The Verilog code implements a simplified elevator control system using a finite state machine (FSM) for predictable behavior based on inputs and system state. In real-world applications, elevators are more complex, featuring advanced scheduling, additional sensors, and enhanced safety mechanisms.
